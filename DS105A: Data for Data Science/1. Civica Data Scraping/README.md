# CIVICA Data Scraping
This project involved web scraping and data wrangling using Python to extract event and agenda information from the CIVICA Social Data Science Network.

**Tasks**
* Part 1: Scraped the CIVICA Schedule page to build a dataframe df_schedule with event title, speaker, date, and link. Exported results to data/schedule.csv.
* Part 2: Used event links to scrape each eventâ€™s agenda. Built a dataframe df_agenda with event_link, talk_title, talk_speakers, and talk_description. Exported results to data/agenda.csv.

**Skills**
* Web scraping with Python (requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas)
* Data cleaning and structuring into CSV
* Organised, well-documented Jupyter Notebook workflow
