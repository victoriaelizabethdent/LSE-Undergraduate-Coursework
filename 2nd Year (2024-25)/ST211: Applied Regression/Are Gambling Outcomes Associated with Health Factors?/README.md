This project simulated an analysis for NHS England to analyse data from a cohort survey run in England and Scotland to identify significant predictors of problem gambling, as the dataset provides comprehensive data on socioeconomic, lifestyle, health, and demographic factors. The report, available in this repository, specifically investigates the impact of health due to the convergence of the literature on the effect of mental health and substance abuse on gambling, while little is known about the effect of physical health (Black et al., 2013) [[1]](#1). The impact of confounding socio-economic, demographic, and lifestyle factors on the model's predictive ability were also explored as health factors do not stand alone; Messerlian et al. (2005) discuss how such research needs to understand socioeconomic factors and cultural influences [[2]](#2). Accordingly, this report details a logistic regression analysis on a cleaned sample of 13,106 English and Scottish individuals, identifying the health factors and confounders associated with problem gambling to be:
