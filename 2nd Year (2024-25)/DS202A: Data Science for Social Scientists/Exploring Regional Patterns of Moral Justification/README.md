<h1 align="center">What Actions Can Be Justified? Are There Regional Differences When it Comes to This?</h1>
<h4 align="center"> Group Coursework for DS202A: Data Science for Social Scientists (40%)</h4>

<p align="center">This project investigated global attitudes toward moral and ethical issues using Wave 7 of the World Values Survey (WVS), analysing over 90,000 responses to questions on actions such as divorce, abortion, and political violence. Hypotheses on regional moral patterns were drawn from academic literature and tested through unsupervised modelling, including hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN, to identify differences across countries. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods such as mean, variance, standard deviation, and Spearman correlations were applied, alongside Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence, to quantify similarities and polarisation in justification scores. In addition, classification models and decision trees were developed to explore predictors of moral attitudes. The findings were consolidated in a 10,000-word co-authored report, combining statistical analysis with a review of existing literature to substantiate conclusions.</p>
