	abstract = {The K-fold Cross Validation ({KCV}) technique is one of the most used approaches by practitioners for model selection and error estimation of classiﬁers. The {KCV} consists in splitting a dataset into k subsets; then, iteratively, some of them are used to learn the model, while the others are exploited to assess its performance. However, in spite of the {KCV} success, only practical rule-of-thumb methods exist to choose the number and the cardinality of the subsets. We propose here an approach, which allows to tune the number of the subsets of the {KCV} in a data–dependent way, so to obtain a reliable, tight and rigorous estimation of the probability of misclassiﬁcation of the chosen model.},

	abstract = {As a technique that can compactly represent complex patterns, machine learning has significant potential for predictive inference. K-fold cross-validation ({CV}) is the most common approach to ascertaining the likelihood that a machine learning outcome is generated by chance, and it frequently outperforms conventional hypothesis testing. This improvement uses measures directly obtained from machine learning classifications, such as accuracy, that do not have a parametric description. To approach a frequentist analysis within machine learning pipelines, a permutation test or simple statistics from data partitions (i.e., folds) can be added to estimate confidence intervals. Unfortunately, neither parametric nor non-parametric tests solve the inherent problems of partitioning small sample-size datasets and learning from heterogeneous data sources. The fact that machine learning strongly depends on the learning parameters and the distribution of data across folds recapitulates familiar difficulties around excess false positives and replication. A novel statistical test based on K-fold {CV} and the Upper Bound of the actual risk (K-fold {CUBV}) is proposed, where uncertain predictions of machine learning with {CV} are bounded by the worst case through the evaluation of concentration inequalities. Probably Approximately Correct-Bayesian upper bounds for linear classifiers in combination with K-fold {CV} are derived and used to estimate the actual risk. The performance with simulated and neuroimaging datasets suggests that K-fold {CUBV} is a robust criterion for detecting effects and validating accuracy values obtained from machine learning and classical {CV} schemes, while avoiding excess false positives.},

Improvements in computational power, recent reductions in the (computational) cost of classification algorithms, and the development of closed-form solutions (for performing cross validation in certain classes of learning algorithms) makes it possible to test thousand or millions of variants of learning models on the data. Thus, it is now possible to calculate cross validation performance on a much larger number of tuned models than would have been possible otherwise. However, we empirically show how under such large number of models the risk for overfitting increases and the performance estimated by cross validation is no longer an effective estimate of generalization; hence, this paper provides an empirical reminder of the dangers of cross validation. We use a closed-form solution that makes this evaluation possible for the cross validation problem of interest. In addition, through extensive experiments we expose and discuss the effects of the overuse/misuse of cross validation in various aspects, including model selection, feature selection, and data dimensionality. This is illustrated on synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets.},

We conducted the study using the {WEKA} software classification model, developed at Waikato University, New Zealand. Defeat results were obtained. None of the four classes envisaged has been determined reliably. We have described all 16 metrics, which are used to evaluate classification models, listed their characteristics, mutual differences, and the parameter that evaluates each of these metrics. We have presented comparative, tabular values that give each metric for each classification model in a concise form, detailed class accuracy with a table of best and worst metric values, confusion matrices for all four classification models, and a type I and {II} error table for all four classification models. In addition to the 16 metric classifications, which we described, we listed seven other metrics, which we did not use because we did not have the opportunity to show their application on the selected data set. Metrics were negatively rated selected, standard reliable, classification models. This led to the conclusion that the data in the selected data set should be pre-processed to be reliably classified by the classification model.},

	shorttitle = {Attitudes Toward Euthanasia},
	abstract = {Context
It is crucial that physicians understand differing attitudes toward euthanasia and which factors to consider when discussing end-of-life decisions with patients and families from diverse backgrounds.
Objectives
To investigate how attitudes toward euthanasia differ among countries, how they change, and how economic, religious, and health-related factors affect these attitudes.
Methods
We analyzed attitudes toward euthanasia and economic, religious, and health-related indicators using longitudinal (1981–2018) World Values Survey ({WVS}) data. They included 62 countries with at least a 15-year, three-wave, time series (total n = 389,243 participants). Each national survey interviewed representative samples of adults (mean = 1405).
Results
In the latest wave, The Netherlands had the most favorable views of euthanasia (10-point scale with 1 = least justifiable: mean = 7.47) and Jordan the least (mean = 1.50). Residents of 23 of 24 high-income countries came to view euthanasia as more justifiable, while residents of 12 of 38 middle- and low-income countries came to view it as less justifiable over time. The higher {GDP} per-capita at the time of survey, the more euthanasia was accepted (r = 0.703; P{\textless} 0.0001); the more important respondents viewed religion as being, the less euthanasia was accepted (r = −0.834; P{\textless} 0.0001); the higher life expectancy and the lower infant mortality were, the more euthanasia was accepted (r = 0.669; P{\textless} 0.0001/r = −0.716; P{\textless} 0.0001).
Conclusion
Euthanasia-related attitudes differ widely depending on the cultural context; changes over time varied in both directions; euthanasia-related attitudes were associated with economic, religious and health-related factors. With globalization increasing cultural diversity, these findings can inform physicians’ communication about end-of-life decisions with patients and families from diverse backgrounds.},

In the first part of this book, instead of simply comparing suicide in different countries, the authors review and examine the fundamental issues of why culture is of vital importance in understanding and preventing suicidal behavior, what the "cultural meaning" of suicide is, and where current research and theory are leading us. The second part of the book then presents (and, importantly, also critiques) exemplary recent research, including a quantitative and qualitative study on the meaning of suicide in Australia, India, and Italy, which is reported in detail, as well as other studies on correlates of suicidal behavior in Kuwait and the {US}, on a culturally specific form of suicide (sati), and on the role of cultural conflict in South Korea. In the concluding section, the editors highlight both the necessity and the challenges of conducting good culturally sensitive studies, as well as suggesting solutions to these challenges.

Testing competing hypotheses derived from attitude research and cross-cultural psychology, we demonstrate that (a) individualist societies exhibit more favorable divorce attitudes than collectivist societies but that (b) there is a curvilinear relationship between culture and type of divorce attitude, such that highly individualist and highly collectivist societies are similar with regard to the structure of prevailing divorce attitudes. The discussion focuses on the broader meanings of endorsing certain types of divorce attitudes in individualist and collectivist cultures.},

	abstract = {Research on public attitudes to the death penalty has been predominantly understood through single nation-states, especially within the {USA}. Examinations of international differences in citizens’ support for the death penalty have been scarce, particularly among continents with a high volume of retentionist nations (e.g. Asia). In this paper, we draw on a dataset of 135,000 people from across 81 nations to examine differences in death penalty support. We find that residents of retentionist nations are generally more supportive of the death penalty than those from abolitionist nations. But this general difference masks important differences both within and between countries. At the country-level, residents of abolitionist nations with autocratic political systems and those with higher homicide levels were more likely to support the death penalty than residents of other abolitionist nations. At the individual level, greater support for a strong dictatorial-type leader and perceptions of political corruption are associated with increased support for the death penalty, but only in abolitionist nations. By contrast, more frequent religious worship, perceived egalitarianism in a nation, and support for the political performance of government reduced death penalty support in abolitionist nations but increased support in retentionist nations, while belief in individual responsibility and critical views towards ethnic minorities increased support for the death penalty across both abolitionist and retentionist nations.},

	abstract = {While the acceptance of homosexuality has risen across many Western countries, we know little about whether or why attitudes have changed in the rest of the world. Here I investigate these questions while also testing the relative utility of three theories of what drives worldwide attitudinal change: (1) the postmaterialist thesis, which casts existential security as a main determinant; (2) world society theory, which emphasizes the influence of a diffusing global culture; and (3) multiple modernities theory, which points to the effect of region-specific cultural programs. Drawing on data from the integrated World Values Survey/European Values Survey (1981-2012), I use a longitudinal multilevel design to model worldwide change in the societal acceptance of homosexuality. In line with world society theory, the results show a broad worldwide upswing in the acceptance of homosexuality, driven largely by the diffusion of favorable global cultural messages. The results provide strong evidence that global culture has shaped collective attitudes globally, although the impact here is found to be less in more religious societies. At the same time, the analysis finds a widening attitudinal gap between countries, and, consistent with multiple modernities theory, suggests this is due in part to the role of region-specific cultural programs. Contrary to the postmaterialist thesis, existential security is not found to have influenced attitudes.},

While there is consensus that {IPV} has disastrous public health consequences, so far, little is known about the drivers of {IPV} acceptability rates. This article therefore analyzes available global opinion data from the World Values Survey ({WVS}) project in 72 countries of the world, representing some four-fifths of the global population. Existing {IPV} data published prior to this study already suggested that the highest global incidence of {IPV} is to be found in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Andean Latin America. Neoliberal political economy in the tradition of Hayek maintained for a long time that the disrespect of property rights and traditional family values can have disastrous social and economic effects. Our study renders support for this theory: On the basis of a variety of statistical analyses, including a factor analysis of 45 key items from the {WVS} data, we conclude that apart from attitudes on gender equality, the disrespect of property rights and traditional family values, analyzed by Hayek, emerge as the major drivers of high acceptability rates of {IPV}. Mali, Serbia, Montenegro, Zambia, Burkina Faso, India, the Philippines, Rwanda, Egypt, and Algeria are on top of this list of global rates of {IPV} acceptability.},

Thus, new attempts in the tax compliance literature try to go beyond standard economic theory. This paper examines citizens’ attitudes toward paying taxes – what is sometimes termed their “tax morale”, or the intrinsic motivation to pay taxes. Tax morale may be a key determinant to explain why people are honest. However, there are very few papers that explore the concept of tax morale theoretically and empirically. This study, based on the World Values Survey and the European Values Survey, therefore attempts to fill this gap in the literature, focusing on tax morale in Austria. Societal variables such as trust or pride have been identified as key determinants that shape tax morale in Austria. Furthermore, a lower perceived compliance leads to a decrease of tax morale, which indicates that social comparisons are relevant. The results also show a decrease of tax morale between 1990 and 1999, although Austria’s taxpayers still have a very high tax morale compared to other European countries.},

It was important for this experiment to gather data from a broader world population to make results more generalizable. Therefore, we examined a total of 589 participants from a global participant pool to evaluate their perceptions of the criminality of online piracy or physical theft of music or software. This experiment hypothesized that (1) the perception of the criminality of illegal downloading of media would be assessed higher ratings by South Asian participants than North American participants, and (2) criminality ratings would be assessed higher ratings by females than males. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four vignettes. They were then asked a series of questions using semantic differential and Likert scales to assess their perception of the criminal act committed in the randomly selected vignette.

Our multiple regression analyses indicate that frequent corporal punishment of children is predicted by higher levels of social stratification and political integration, and long-term use of an alien currency. These findings are consistent with our theory that societies are likely to practice corporal punishment to prepare children for living in a society with native or imposed (e.g., colonial) power inequality. In addition, corporal punishment appears more likely in societies in which nonrelative caretakers help raise children. And in nonpacified societies, undemocratic political decision making and a culture of violence also predict corporal punishment of children.},

	shorttitle = {Perception and Interpretation of Terrorism, Justice, and Conflict},
	abstract = {How do people see and interpret violence or conflict when it occurs? Why does it occur again and again? Although these are fundamental questions about human nature, psychologists and other social scientists cannot af-ford to avoid these tough and painful issues. We may not be able to build a perfect utopia, but it is imperative that we seek to increase understand-ing of human conflict and develop strategies to reduce it. In this chapter, we will focus on how people of different cultures see and interpret the events surrounding September 11, 2001 (for more detail, see Barringer, 2001). For example, how do people perceive Americans bombing in Af-ghanistan? Is the September 11 attack perceived as a heroic or a terrorist behavior? Is the American military response to this event a terrorist act or a necessary and justified reaction? Who should be responsible for the conflict or violence that has occurred? Simply speaking, we attempt to address three general questions in the current chapter. First, we briefly report the results of an exploratory sur-vey regarding perceptions and interpretations of the 9–11 event, as well as perceptions of what constitutes "terrorism" and "justice" in three dif-ferent cultures (i.e., Christian, Chinese, and Islamic). 1 The results of this exploratory analysis lead directly to our second concern, namely, why do these three cultures perceive and interpret the 9–11 event, terrorism, con-flict, and violence differently? In this second section, we consider the uni-versal nature of the human need for justice as well as cultural differences that might account for intercultural differences in the way that terrorism, justice, and conflict are perceived. Finally, we conclude by highlighting some important lessons to be gleaned from this research. Approximately two months after the 9–11 event in 2001, participants were recruited from three different cultures (N 79 self-identified Chris-tian Americans; N 54 Islamic subjects from Pakistan, Egypt, and Ban-gladesh; and N 93 Chinese students primarily from China). All of these participants were college students whose age ranged from 18 to 26 years. 2 The American sample was recruited from a midwestern university, and the Islamic sample was obtained from a midwestern university's foreign student office. The Chinese sample was recruited primarily from a uni-versity in Mainland China. The Christian American sample was recruited from an introductory psychology class. The Chinese students were re-cruited from a psychology class and also from students in the libraries. The Islamic students were recruited by an Islamic graduate assistant who approached them in the dorms, the university library, or the cafeteria. There were no significant differences among the three samples with regard to age, gender, or education. Thus, this sampling strategy enabled us to compare the three cultures while controlling for these factors.},

	abstract = {Scholars maintain that higher wages for public servants would make the public sector more efficient and reduce the abuse of power. This article challenges this idea and suggests that higher wages may actually increase public corruption. We argue that increasing pecuniary incentives for public service might lead public employees to advance their own self-interests and encourage justifications for accepting bribes. We test our theory empirically using 18,800 observations from 58 countries taken from the sixth wave of the World Values Survey. The findings confirm our theory and suggest a positive association between public servants’ wages and the toleration of corruption.},

	abstract = {More than 35 years ago, I suggested that ‘a transformation may be taking place in the political culture of advanced industrial societies. This transformation seems to be altering the basic value priorities of given generations as a result of changing conditions influencing their basic socialization’ (Inglehart 1971: 991). Survey evidence from six West European societies revealed large differences between the value priorities of older and younger generations. Among the older cohorts, ‘materialist’ values, emphasising economic and physical security, were overwhelmingly predominant – but as one moved from older to younger birth cohorts, ‘post-materialist’ values, emphasising autonomy and self-expression, became increasingly widespread. The differences were striking. Among those aged 65 or older, materialists were fully 12 times as numerous as post-materialists; among those born after World War {II} (who were under 25 in 1970), post-materialists were slightly more numerous than materialists.},

A cluster analysis performed on individual scores of self-reliance (individualist dimension), group-oriented interdependence (collectivist dimension), and competitiveness (individualist or collectivist dimension) yielded a typology of four constrained combinations of these dimensions. Despite the prevalence of a typology group within a given country, variability was observed in all countries. Self-reliant non-competitors and interdependent non-competitors were prevalent among participants from Western nations, whereas self-reliant competitors and interdependent competitors were more common in non-Western countries. These findings emphasize the benefits for cross-cultural research of a typological approach based on combinations of individualist and collectivist dimensions.},
