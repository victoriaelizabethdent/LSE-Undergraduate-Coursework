<h4 align="center"> Coursework for DS105A: Data for Data Science (20%)</h4>

<p align="center">This coursework involved web scraping and data wrangling using Python to obtain information from the CIVICA Social Data Science Network. The Jupyter Notebook details the extraction of event data from CIVICA, first compiling structured data on event titles, speakers, dates, and links into a dataframe and exporting it as schedule.csv then extending the pipeline to scrape detailed agendas from each event page, producing a second dataframe with talk titles, speakers, and descriptions, saved as agenda.csv. HTML was partially used to identify the data needed for the coursework.</p>
