<h4 align="center">Group Coursework for DS105A: Data for Data Science (25%)</h4>

<p align="center">This group project involved creating an interactive webpage to help users identify the best value-for-money properties in London, integrating data on house prices, number of bedrooms, crime rates, air quality, and distance from central London. The data was primarily collected from RightMove, alongside Google API and PlumPlot for environmental metrics, and Python was used for data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis. The project included generating heat maps of crime rates and air quality using Folium, calculating overall property rankings with a weighted formula, visualising house price inflation over time with Plotnine, and building a bespoke interactive Dash app allowing users to filter listings by their preferences.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Addressing the Feedback</b></p>
<p align="center">While some repository organisation issues and plot rendering challenges limited the presentation, the project provided invaluable experience in data cleaning, wrangling, and building interactive visualisations. I strengthened my skills in integrating multiple datasets and creating a user-focused dashboard, turning these hurdles into practical learning opportunities.</p>
