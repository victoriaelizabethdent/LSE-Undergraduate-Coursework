<h1 align="center">Wikimedia Data Scraping: UK Parliamentary Consituencies</h1>
<h4 align="center"> Coursework for DS105A: Data for Data Science (30%)</h4>

<p align="center">This coursework involved large-scale web scraping and exploratory data analysis using Python to collect and analyse data on all UK Parliamentary constituencies from Wikipedia. The project first scraped constituency names and links, building a dataframe of all constituencies ever created. It then distinguished between current and abolished constituencies, appended information on country, electorate size, and election turnout, and attempted to extract further details on Members of Parliament. The dataset was cleaned and structured in pandas, with variables converted to appropriate types, enabling a series of analyses and visualisations such as constituency counts, electorate distribution, turnout comparisons, and common naming patterns.</p>
